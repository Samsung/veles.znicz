It means that Model can change for any Model (Convolutional, Fully connected, different parameters) in configuration file. Package contains three configuration files: mnist_config for fully-connected Neural Network with parameters, which can be modified by Genetic algorithm, mnist_conv_config for convolutional Neural Network with parameters, which were modified by Genetic Algorithm, mnist_caffe_config for convolutional Neural Network with parameters just like in Caffe.",
