# Subdirectory instructions

# 1. Create Makefile.am in the subdirectory:

#include $(top_srcdir)/Makefile.common

#noinst_LTLIBRARIES = lib_subdir.la

# Compiler options
#lib_subdir_la_CPPFLAGS =

# 2. Add subdir/Makefile to configure.ac at AC_CONFIG_FILES

# 3. Add reference to lib_subdir.la in libZnicz.la:

# libZnicz_la_LIBADD = subdir/lib_subdir.la

# 4. Add subdir to parent directory Makefile.am's PARALLEL_SUBDIRS

# PARALLEL_SUBDIRS = subdir
